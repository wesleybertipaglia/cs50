# Practice

If you want some extra practice after completing the problem set for a week, you can choose from these practice problems. These are not warm-up exercises; in many cases, they can be harder than the problem set problems themselves!

All of these problems are entirely optional and cannot be submitted!

You can find the practice problems in this link: [Practice Problems](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/practice/)
