# Representation

It is a way to encode information in a format that can be used by a computer program. For example, a computer program can represent a number as a sequence of bits, a string as a sequence of characters, or an image as a sequence of pixels.

## Common Representations

- **Numbers**: Integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers, etc.
- **Strings**: Sequences of characters.
- **Colors**: RGB, HEX, CMYK, HSL, etc.
- **Images**: Sequences of pixels.
- **Audio**: Sequences of samples.
- **Video**: Sequences of frames.
- **Files**: Sequences of bytes.
- **Network Packets**: Sequences of bits.
