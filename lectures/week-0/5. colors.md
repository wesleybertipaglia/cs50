### RGB

RGB is the acronym for Red, Green, Blue. It is an additive color model in which red, green, and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representation, and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers, though it has also been used in conventional photography.

Examples:

- RED: `255, 0, 0`
- GREEN: `0, 255, 0`
- BLUE: `0, 0, 255`
- WHITE: `255, 255, 255`
- BLACK: `0, 0, 0`
- YELLOW: `255, 255, 0`
- CYAN: `0, 255, 255`
- MAGENTA: `255, 0, 255`
- GRAY: `128, 128, 128`

### HEX

HEX is the acronym for Hexadecimal. It is a base-16 number system used to represent colors on the web. The HEX color code is a six-digit code that represents the amount of red, green, and blue in a color. The first two digits represent the red color, the next two digits represent the green color, and the last two digits represent the blue color.

Examples:

- RED: `#FF0000`
