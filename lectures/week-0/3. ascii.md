# ASCII

Just as numbers are binary patterns of ones and zeros, letters are represented using ones and zeros too!

Since there is an overlap between the ones and zeros that represent numbers and letters, the ASCII standard was created to map specific letters to specific numbers.

For example, the letter A was decided to map to the number 65. 01000001 represents the number 65 in binary.

If you received a text message, the binary under that message might represent the numbers 72, 73, and 33. Mapping these out to ASCII, your message would look as follows:

```text
H   I   !
72  73  33
```

Thank goodness for standards like ASCII that allow us to agree upon these values!

Here is an expanded map of ASCII values:

| Decimal | Binary | Hexadecimal | Character |
|---------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| 48      | 110000 | 30          | 0         |
| 49      | 110001 | 31          | 1         |
| 50      | 110010 | 32          | 2         |
| 51      | 110011 | 33          | 3         |
| 52      | 110100 | 34          | 4         |
| 53      | 110101 | 35          | 5         |
| 54      | 110110 | 36          | 6         |
| 55      | 110111 | 37          | 7         |
| 56      | 111000 | 38          | 8         |
| 57      | 111001 | 39          | 9         |


This is not all of the ASCII values, the table goes from 0 to 255, if you want you can see an extended version of the table [here](./ascii-table.md).

Since binary can only count up to 255 we are limited to the number of characters represented by ASCII.
