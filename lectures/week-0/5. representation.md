# Representation

It is a way to encode information in a format that can be used by a computer program. For example, a computer program can represent a number as a sequence of bits, a string as a sequence of characters, or an image as a sequence of pixels.

## Common Representations

- **Numbers**: Integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers, etc.
- **Strings**: Sequences of characters.
- **Images**: Sequences of pixels.
- **Audio**: Sequences of samples.
- **Video**: Sequences of frames.
- **Files**: Sequences of bytes.
- **Network Packets**: Sequences of bits.
- **Colors**: RGB, CMYK, HSL, etc.

## Representing Numbers

Numbers can be represented in different ways, such as:

- **Binary**: Base-2 representation.
- **Octal**: Base-8 representation.
- **Decimal**: Base-10 representation.
- **Hexadecimal**: Base-16 representation.

## Representing Strings

Strings can be represented in different ways, such as:

- **ASCII**: American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
- **Unicode**: A standard for encoding, representing, and handling text in most of the world's writing systems.
- **UTF-8**: A variable-width character encoding capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid character code points in Unicode using one to four one-byte (8-bit) code units.
- **UTF-16**: A variable-width character encoding capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid character code points in Unicode using one or two 16-bit code units.
- **UTF-32**: A fixed-width character encoding capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid character code points in Unicode using one 32-bit code unit.

## Representing Images

Images can be represented in different ways, such as:

- **Bitmap**: A pixel-based representation of an image.
- **Vector**: A mathematical representation of an image using geometric primitives.
- **JPEG**: A lossy compression algorithm for digital images.
- **PNG**: A lossless compression algorithm for digital images.
- **GIF**: A lossless compression algorithm for digital images.

## Representing Audio

Audio can be represented in different ways, such as:

- **Waveform**: A time-domain representation of an audio signal.
- **Spectrum**: A frequency-domain representation of an audio signal.
- **MP3**: A lossy compression algorithm for digital audio.
- **WAV**: A lossless compression algorithm for digital audio.
- **FLAC**: A lossless compression algorithm for digital audio.

## Representing Video

Video can be represented in different ways, such as:

- **Frame**: A single image in a sequence of images.
- **MPEG**: A lossy compression algorithm for digital video.
- **AVI**: A lossless compression algorithm for digital video.
- **MOV**: A lossless compression algorithm for digital video.
- **MP4**: A lossless compression algorithm for digital video.

## Representing Files

Files can be represented in different ways, such as:

- **Text**: A sequence of characters.
- **Binary**: A sequence of bytes.
- **Compressed**: A sequence of compressed bytes.
- **Encrypted**: A sequence of encrypted bytes.
- **Metadata**: A sequence of metadata bytes.

## Representing Colors

Colors can be represented in different ways, such as:

- **RGB**: Red, Green, Blue.
- **CMYK**: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black.
- **HSL**: Hue, Saturation, Lightness.
- **HSV**: Hue, Saturation, Value.
- **YUV**: Luminance, Chrominance.
