# Pseudocode

Pseudocode is a way to represent an algorithm in a way that is easy to understand and implement. It is not a programming language, but rather a way to describe the steps of an algorithm in a way that is easy to understand.

## Characteristics of Pseudocode

Pseudocode has the following characteristics:

- **Informal**: Pseudocode is not a formal language, so there are no strict rules for writing it.
- **Readable**: Pseudocode should be easy to read and understand.
- **Structured**: Pseudocode should be structured in a way that makes it easy to follow.
- **Language-independent**: Pseudocode should be independent of any programming language.

## Importance of Pseudocode

Pseudocoding is such an important skill for at least two reasons. First, when you pseudocode before you create formal code, it allows you to think through the logic of your problem in advance. Second, when you pseudocode, you can later provide this information to others that are seeking to understand your coding decisions and how your code works.

## Example

Here is an example of pseudocode for finding the maximum of two numbers:

```
function max(a, b)
    if a > b
        return a
    else
        return b
```

This pseudocode describes a function `max` that takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns the maximum of the two numbers.
