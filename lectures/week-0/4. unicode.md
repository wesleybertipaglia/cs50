# UNICODE

As time has rolled on, there are more and more ways to communicate via text.

Since there were not enough digits in binary to represent all the various characters that could be represented by humans, the Unicode standard expanded the number of bits that can be transmitted and understood by computers. Unicode includes not only special characters, but emoji as well.

There are emoji that you probably use every day. The following may look familiar to you:

| Emoji | Unicode |
|-------|---------|
| 😂    | U+1F602 | 
| 😍    | U+1F60D |
| 😎    | U+1F60E |
| 😜    | U+1F61C |
| 😡    | U+1F621 |
| 😢    | U+1F622 |
| 😭    | U+1F62D |
| 😱    | U+1F631 |
| 😳    | U+1F633 |
| 😴    | U+1F634 |
| 😵    | U+1F635 |
| 😷    | U+1F637 |
| 👍    | U+1F44D |
| 👎    | U+1F44E |
| 👏    | U+1F44F |
| 👑    | U+1F451 |


Computer scientists faced a challenge when wanting to assign various skin tones to each emoji to allow the communication to be further personalized. In this case, the creators and contributors of emoji decided that the initial bits would be the structure of the emoji itself, followed by skin tone.

For example, the unicode for a generic thumbs up is `U+1F44D`. However, the following represents the same thumbs up with a different skin tone: `U+1F44D` `U+1F3FD`.

More and more features are being added to the Unicode standard to represent further characters and emoji.
