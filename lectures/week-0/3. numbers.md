# Representing Numbers

Numbers can be represented in different ways, such as:

- **Unary**: A simple way to represent numbers using only one symbol.
- **Binary**: A numeral system with a base of 2.
- **Octal**: A numeral system with a base of 8.
- **Decimal**: A numeral system with a base of 10.
- **Hexadecimal**: A numeral system with a base of 16.

## Unary

Unary is the simplest numeral system, it's a base-1 system and it's used to represent numbers using only one symbol.

It is used to represent numbers by repeating the same symbol a number of times. For example, the number `3` can be represented as `III`.

Examples:

- from `0` to `1` is represented as `0` to `1`
- `2` is represented as `II` (2 * 1)
- `3` is represented as `III` (3 * 1)
- `5` is represented as `IIIII` (5 * 1)

## Binary

Binary is the most common numeral system, it's a base-2 system and it's the system the computer uses to represent data and perform calculations.

It is used to represent numbers using two symbols, such as `0` and `1`. For example, the number `3` can be represented as `11`.

Examples:

- from `0` to `1` is represented as `0` to `1`
- `2` is represented as `10` (1 * 2 + 0)
- `3` is represented as `11` (1 * 2 + 1)
- `5` is represented as `101` (1 * 4 + 0 * 2 + 1)
- `8` is represented as `1000` (1 * 8 + 0 * 4 + 0 * 2 + 0)

## Octal

Octal is a numeral system with a base of 8. It's used in computer programming to represent numbers in a more compact form.

It is used to represent numbers using eight symbols, from `0` to `7`. For example, the number `8` is represented as `10`.

Examples:

- from `0` to `7` is represented as `0` to `7`
- `8` is represented as `10` (1 * 8 + 0)
- `9` is represented as `11` (1 * 8 + 1)
- `45` is represented as `55` (5 * 8 + 5)
- `100` is represented as `144` (1 * 64 + 4 * 8 + 0)

## Decimal

Decimal is the most familiar numeral system, it's a base-10 system and it's the system we use in everyday life. 

It is used to represent numbers using ten symbols, from `0` to `9`, and then it starts over with a `1` in the tens place. For example, `9` is followed by `10`.

Examples:

- from `0` to `9` is represented as `0` to `9`
- `10` is represented as `10` (1 * 10 + 0)
- `11` is represented as `11` (1 * 10 + 1)
- `45` is represented as `45` (4 * 10 + 5)
- `100` is represented as `100` (1 * 100 + 0 * 10 + 0)

## Hexadecimal

Hexadecimal is a numeral system with a base of 16. It's commonly used in computer science and programming because it can represent large numbers in a more compact form turning it easier to read and write.

It is used to represent numbers using sixteen symbols, from `0` to `9`, and then it continues with `A` to `F`. For example, the number `15` is represented as `F`.

Examples:

- from `0` to `9` is represented as `0` to `9`
- from `10` to `15` is represented as `A` to `F`
- `16` is represented as `10` (1 * 16 + 0)
- `30` is represented as `1E` (1 * 16 + 14)
- `255` is represented as `FF` (15 * 16 + 15)
