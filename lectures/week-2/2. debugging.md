# Debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in a computer program. It is a crucial skill for programmers. In this lesson, we will learn about debugging and some common techniques to debug programs.

Debugging is important because it helps programmers identify and correct errors in their code. Errors in programs can cause unexpected behavior, crashes, or incorrect results. By debugging their code, programmers can ensure that their programs work as intended and produce the correct output.

## Common debugging techniques

There are several common techniques that programmers use to debug their code:

1. **Print statements**: One of the simplest and most effective debugging techniques is to use print statements to output the values of variables at different points in the program. By examining the output of these print statements, programmers can identify where the program is going wrong.

2. **Step-by-step execution**: Another useful technique is to step through the program line by line, examining the values of variables at each step. This can help programmers identify where the program is deviating from the expected behavior.

3. **Using a debugger**: Debuggers are tools that allow programmers to step through their code, set breakpoints, and examine the values of variables at different points in the program. Debuggers can be powerful tools for identifying and fixing errors in programs.

4. **Reading error messages**: When a program crashes or produces an error, it often displays an error message that provides information about what went wrong. By reading and understanding these error messages, programmers can identify the cause of the error and fix it.

5. **Code review**: Another effective debugging technique is to have another programmer review your code. A fresh pair of eyes can often spot errors that the original programmer missed.
