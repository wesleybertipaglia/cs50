# Strings in C

In C, a string is an array of characters that is terminated by a null character (`'\0'`). Strings in C are used to represent text data, such as names, addresses, and messages.

## How do I declare a string in C?

You can declare a string in C by using an array of characters. The syntax for declaring a string in C is as follows:

```c
char name[50];
```

This declares a string called `name` that can store up to 50 characters.

## How do I initialize a string in C?

You can initialize a string in C by specifying the characters of the string when you declare it. The syntax for initializing a string in C is as follows:

```c
char name[] = "Hello, world!";
```

This initializes a string called `name` with the value `"Hello, world!"`.

## How do I access characters in a string in C?

You can access characters in a string in C by using the index of the character. The syntax for accessing a character in a string in C is as follows:

```c
char third_character = name[2];
```

This accesses the third character in the `name` string and stores it in a variable called `third_character`.

## How do I loop through a string in C?

You can loop through a string in C by using a `for` loop. The syntax for looping through a string in C is as follows:

```c
for (int i = 0; name[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    printf("%c", name[i]);
}
```

This loops through the `name` string until it reaches the null character (`'\0'`) and prints each character in the string.
