# Compiling in C

A compiler is a program that translates code written in a high-level programming language (like C) into machine code, which is a low-level programming language that the computer can understand. The compiler reads the code written by the programmer and translates it into a language that the computer can understand. This process is called compiling.

## How does a compiler work?

A compiler works by reading the code written by the programmer and translating it into machine code. The compiler reads the code line by line, checking for errors and translating the code into machine code. If the compiler finds an error in the code, it will stop compiling and display an error message to the programmer.

## What is the difference between compiling and interpreting?

Compiling and interpreting are two different ways of translating code written in a high-level programming language into machine code. Compiling translates the entire code into machine code before running it, while interpreting translates the code line by line as it is being run. Compiling is generally faster than interpreting, but interpreting is more flexible and can be easier to debug.

## Compiling a C program

1. Compile a C program using the `gcc` command.

```bash
gcc -o program program.c
```

2. Run the compiled program.

```bash
./program
```
