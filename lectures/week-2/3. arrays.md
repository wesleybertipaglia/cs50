# Arrays in C

An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same type. Each element in an array is identified by an index, which is a number that represents the position of the element in the array. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, making it easier to work with large sets of data.

## How do arrays work?

Arrays work by storing a collection of elements in contiguous memory locations. Each element in the array is stored at a specific index, which allows the program to access and manipulate the elements using the index. Arrays are zero-indexed, which means that the first element in the array is stored at index 0, the second element is stored at index 1, and so on.


Physically, on the memory of your computer, you can imagine how specific types of data are stored on your computer. You might imagine that a char, which only requires 1 byte of memory, may look as follows:

## How do I declare an array in C?

To declare an array in C, you need to specify the type of the elements in the array and the size of the array. The syntax for declaring an array in C is as follows:

```c
int numbers[5];
```

This declares an array called `numbers` that can store 5 integers.

## How do I initialize an array in C?

You can initialize an array in C by specifying the values of the elements in the array when you declare it. The syntax for initializing an array in C is as follows:

```c
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

This initializes an array called `numbers` with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

## How do I access elements in an array in C?

You can access elements in an array in C by using the index of the element. The syntax for accessing an element in an array in C is as follows:

```c
int third_element = numbers[2];
```

This accesses the third element in the `numbers` array and stores it in a variable called `third_element`.

## How do I loop through an array in C?

You can loop through an array in C by using a `for` loop. The syntax for looping through an array in C is as follows:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", numbers[i]);
}
```

This loops through the `numbers` array and prints each element to the console.
