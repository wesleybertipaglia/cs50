# Command-line Arguments in C

Command-line arguments are values that are passed to a program when it is run from the command line. These values can be used by the program to modify its behavior or perform specific tasks. Command-line arguments are typically used to provide input to a program or specify options that control how the program operates.

## How are command-line arguments passed to a C program?

In C, command-line arguments are passed to a program through the `main` function. The `main` function is the entry point of a C program, and it can accept two arguments: `argc` and `argv`.

- `argc` is an integer that represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program.

- `argv` is an array of strings that contains the actual command-line arguments. Each element of the `argv` array is a string that represents one of the command-line arguments.

## How do I access command-line arguments in a C program?

To access command-line arguments in a C program, you can use the `argc` and `argv` parameters of the `main` function. The `argc` parameter tells you how many command-line arguments were passed to the program, and the `argv` parameter is an array of strings that contains the actual arguments.

Here is an example of a simple C program that prints out the command-line arguments passed to it:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("Argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this program, the `main` function accepts two parameters: `argc` and `argv`. The `for` loop iterates over the `argv` array and prints out each command-line argument along with its index.

## How do I run a C program with command-line arguments?

To run a C program with command-line arguments, you can pass the arguments after the program name when running it from the command line. For example, to run the program above with the arguments "hello" and "world", you would type the following command:

```bash
./program hello world
```

This would run the program and pass the arguments "hello" and "world" to it.
