# Week 2 - Arrays

In our previous session, we learned about C, a text-based programming language.

This week, we are going to take a deeper look at additional building-blocks that will support our goals of learning more about programming from the bottom up.

Fundamentally, in addition to the essentials of programming, this course is about problem-solving. Accordingly, we will also focus further on how to approach computer science problems.
