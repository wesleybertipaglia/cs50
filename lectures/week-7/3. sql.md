# SQL

SQL is a language used to interact with databases. It stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to store, manipulate and retrieve data from databases.

## SQL Basics

### Creating a Database

To create a new database in SQL, you can use the `CREATE DATABASE` statement followed by the name of the database. For example:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
```

This statement creates a new database named `mydatabase`.

### Creating a Table

To create a new table in SQL, you can use the `CREATE TABLE` statement followed by the name of the table and the columns it should contain. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT
);
```

This statement creates a new table named `users` with three columns: `id`, `name`, and `age`. The `id` column is defined as the primary key.

### Inserting Data

To insert data into a table in SQL, you can use the `INSERT INTO` statement followed by the name of the table and the values to insert. For example:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John', 25);
```

This statement inserts a new row into the `users` table with the values `1`, `'John'`, and `25` for the `id`, `name`, and `age` columns, respectively.

### Querying Data

To query data from a table in SQL, you can use the `SELECT` statement followed by the columns you want to retrieve and the table you want to retrieve them from. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

This statement retrieves all columns from the `users` table.

### Updating Data

To update data in a table in SQL, you can use the `UPDATE` statement followed by the table you want to update, the columns you want to update, and the new values. For example:

```sql
UPDATE users SET age = 30 WHERE name = 'John';
```

This statement updates the `age` column in the `users` table to `30` for the row where the `name` column is `'John'`.

### Deleting Data

To delete data from a table in SQL, you can use the `DELETE FROM` statement followed by the table you want to delete from and a condition to specify which rows to delete. For example:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE name = 'John';
```

This statement deletes all rows from the `users` table where the `name` column is `'John'`.

## SQL Joins

SQL joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are different types of joins in SQL, including:

- INNER JOIN: Returns rows when there is a match in both tables.

- LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table.

- RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table.

- FULL JOIN: Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables.

Here is an example of an INNER JOIN in SQL:

```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.product
FROM users
INNER JOIN orders
ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

This statement retrieves the `name` column from the `users` table and the `product` column from the `orders` table where there is a match between the `id` column in the `users` table and the `user_id` column in the `orders` table.
