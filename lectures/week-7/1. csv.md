# CSV (Comma Separated Values)

It is a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. A CSV file stores tabular data in plain text, with each row representing a data record and each column representing a field. Each field in a CSV file is separated from the next by a comma. CSV files are commonly used to transfer data between different programs, such as transferring data from a database to a spreadsheet or vice versa. CSV files are easy to read and write, making them a popular choice for storing and transferring data.

## Example of a CSV file

```csv
Name, Age,
John, 25,
Jane, 30,
Alice, 20,
```

In the example above, the first row contains the column headers (Name, Age), and the subsequent rows contain the data records. Each field is separated by a comma, and each row is terminated by a newline character.

## Reading and Writing CSV Files in Python

Python provides a built-in `csv` module for reading and writing CSV files. The `csv` module provides functions for reading and writing CSV files, making it easy to work with tabular data in Python.

### Reading a CSV File

To read a CSV file in Python, you can use the `csv.reader` class. The `csv.reader` class reads data from a CSV file and returns it as a list of lists, where each list represents a row of data.

```python
import csv

with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

In the example above, we open the file `data.csv` in read mode and create a `csv.reader` object to read data from the file. We then iterate over the rows of data and print each row.

### Writing to a CSV File

To write data to a CSV file in Python, you can use the `csv.writer` class. The `csv.writer` class writes data to a CSV file in tabular format.

```python
import csv

data = [
    ['Name', 'Age'],
    ['John', 25],
    ['Jane', 30],
    ['Alice', 20]
]

with open('data.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(data)
```

In the example above, we create a list of lists `data` representing the tabular data we want to write to the CSV file. We then open the file `data.csv` in write mode and create a `csv.writer` object to write data to the file. We use the `writerows` method to write the data to the file.
