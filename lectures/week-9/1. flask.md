# Flask Framework

## What is Flask?
Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework that provides tools, libraries, and patterns to build web applications quickly and efficiently. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it ideal for beginners and experienced developers alike.

## Key Features:

### 1. **Minimalist and Lightweight:**
- Flask is minimalist and does not impose any dependencies or project structure.
- It allows developers to choose the components they need, promoting simplicity and flexibility.

### 2. **Routing:**
- URL routing is handled using decorators (`@app.route('/')`) to map URLs to Python functions (view functions).
- Supports dynamic routes and parameter passing.

### 3. **Templates:**
- Flask uses Jinja2 templating engine to render HTML templates with dynamic data.
- Templates support template inheritance, macros, filters, and control structures.

### 4. **HTTP Request Handling:**
- Easily handles HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using decorators (`@app.route`).
- Provides access to request data (form data, JSON, files) using `request` object.

### 5. **Extensions:**
- Flask has a rich ecosystem of extensions for common tasks like form validation, database integration (SQLAlchemy), authentication (Flask-Login), and more.
- Extensions are easy to integrate and extend Flask's functionality as needed.

### 6. **Deployment and Scalability:**
- Flask applications can be deployed on various platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS) and integrated with WSGI servers (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI).
- Supports scaling using techniques like load balancing and caching.

### 7. **RESTful APIs:**
- Flask is suitable for building RESTful APIs using Flask-RESTful or Flask-RestPlus extensions.
- Provides tools for defining endpoints, handling request/response serialization, and supporting different HTTP methods.

## Example Flask Application:
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello, World!'

@app.route('/greet/<name>')
def greet(name):
    return f'Hello, {name}!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
