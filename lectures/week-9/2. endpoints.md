# Endpoints, URLs, URIs, and Parameters

## Endpoint:

### What is an Endpoint?
An endpoint is a specific URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in a web API or web service that is used to interact with resources. It defines where and how clients can access resources provided by a web server.

### Components of an Endpoint:
- **Base URL**: The root URL of the API or web service.
- **Path**: The specific path or route appended to the base URL to identify the resource.
- **HTTP Method**: Specifies the action to be performed on the resource (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

## URL (Uniform Resource Locator):

### What is a URL?
A URL is the address used to access resources on the web. It specifies the protocol (e.g., http, https), domain name or IP address, port (optional), path, and query parameters.

### Example URL Components:
- **Protocol**: `http://`, `https://`
- **Domain**: `example.com`
- **Port**: `:8080` (optional)
- **Path**: `/api/users`
- **Query Parameters**: `?page=1&limit=10`

## URI (Uniform Resource Identifier):

### What is a URI?
A URI is a string that identifies a resource. It includes URLs, URNs (Uniform Resource Names), and URCs (Uniform Resource Characteristics).

### URI vs. URL:
- **URL**: Specifies the location of a resource and how to retrieve it (e.g., `https://example.com/api/users`).
- **URN**: Specifies the name of a resource without specifying how to locate it (e.g., `urn:isbn:0451450523`).

## Parameters:

### Path Parameters:
- Part of the endpoint's path that identifies a specific resource.
- Example: `/api/users/{id}`, where `{id}` is a path parameter.

### Query Parameters:
- Optional parameters appended to the end of a URL after the `?` character.
- Used for filtering, sorting, or providing additional information.
- Example: `/api/users?page=1&limit=10`.

### Request Body:
- Used in POST, PUT, and PATCH requests to send data to the server.
- Contains data in JSON, XML, or other formats.

## Importance of Endpoints and URLs:
Endpoints and URLs are fundamental in web development and APIs, providing a structured way to access and manipulate resources over the internet. They define the interaction points between clients (e.g., web browsers, mobile apps) and servers, enabling communication and data exchange.
