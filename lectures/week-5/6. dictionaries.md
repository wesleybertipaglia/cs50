# Dictionaries

Dictionaries are a data structure that allows you to store key-value pairs. They are similar to lists, but instead of using an index to access elements, you use a key. Dictionaries are unordered, meaning that the order of the elements is not guaranteed.

## Creating a Dictionary in C

In C, you can create a dictionary using a struct that contains a key and a value. Here's an example of how you might define a dictionary that maps strings to integers:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct dictionary {
    char *key;
    int value;
};

int main() {
    struct dictionary dict[] = {
        {"apple", 5},
        {"banana", 10},
        {"cherry", 15}
    };

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("%s: %d\n", dict[i].key, dict[i].value);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
