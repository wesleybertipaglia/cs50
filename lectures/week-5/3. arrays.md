## Resizing Arrays

Resizing arrays is a common operation in programming, especially when the size of the array needs to be increased or decreased dynamically.

This opperation is a little more complex than it seems at first glance. When resizing an array, probably the next memory block is already occupied by another data structure.

To solve this problem, we can create a new array with the desired size, copy the elements from the old array to the new array, and then free the memory occupied by the old array.

Here is an example of resizing an array in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int* resizeArray(int* arr, int size, int newSize) {
    int* newArr = (int*)malloc(newSize * sizeof(int));
    if (newArr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return NULL;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        newArr[i] = arr[i];
    }

    free(arr);
    return newArr;
}
```

In this example, the `resizeArray` function takes the old array `arr`, its size `size`, and the new size `newSize` as input parameters. It allocates memory for a new array `newArr` of the desired size, copies the elements from the old array to the new array, and then frees the memory occupied by the old array.
