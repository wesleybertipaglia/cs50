# Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Operations

1. **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.

2. **Pop**: Removes an element from the top of the stack.

3. **Peek**: Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.

4. **Empty**: Checks if the stack is empty.

5. **Full**: Checks if the stack is full.

## Types of Stacks

- **Simple Stack**: A simple stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO principle.

- **Dynamic Stack**: A dynamic stack is a stack that can grow or shrink in size dynamically.

- **Array Stack**: An array stack is a stack implemented using an array.

- **Linked List Stack**: A linked list stack is a stack implemented using a linked list.

## Implementation of Stack

A stack can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The following is an example of a stack implemented using an array in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int arr[capacity];
    int size;
} Stack;

// implementation of stack operations
```

## Time Complexity of Stack Operations

1. **Push**: O(1)

2. **Pop**: O(1)

3. **Peek**: O(1)

4. **Empty**: O(1)

5. **Full**: O(1)

The time complexity of stack operations is O(1) because the elements are inserted and removed from the top of the stack in constant time.
