# Linked Lists

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next element in the sequence. The elements are called nodes, and each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

You might imagine three values stored at three different areas of memory as follows:

How could one stitch together these values in a list? We could imagine this data pictured above as follows:

We could utilize more memory to keep track of where the next item is.

Notice that NULL is utilized to indicate that nothing else is next in the list.

By convention, we would keep one more element in memory, a pointer, that keeps track of the first item in the list.

Abstracting away the memory addresses, the list would appear as follows:

The first element in the list is called the head, and the last element is called the tail. The tail points to NULL, indicating the end of the list.

## -> Operator

The `->` operator is used to access the members of a structure through a pointer. For example, if we have a pointer to a node, we can access the value of the node using the `->` operator.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct node
{
    int value;
    struct node *next;
}

int main(void)
{
    struct node *n = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    n->value = 1;
    n->next = NULL;

    printf("%i\n", n->value);
}
```

In the code above, we define a structure called `node` that contains an integer value and a pointer to the next node. We then create a pointer to a node called `n` and allocate memory for it using `malloc`. We then set the value of `n` to 1 and the next pointer to NULL. Finally, we print the value of `n` using the `->` operator.
