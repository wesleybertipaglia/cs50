# Trie

A Trie is a tree of arrays where each node represents a character. Every node in a trie is an array of 26 characters (a-z).

The root node is an empty array. Each node in the trie represents a character. The children of a node represent the next character in the string.

Here is an example of a trie structure:

```c
typedef struct Trie
{
    struct Trie *children[26];
    char *number;
} Trie;
```

## Complexity

The operations on a trie are very efficient, the time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string, but the space complexity is O(26^n) which is very high.
