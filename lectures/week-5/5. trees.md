# Trees

Trees are a non-linear data structure that are used to represent hierarchical relationships. They are a collection of nodes connected by edges. Each node has a value and a list of references to other nodes. 

The top node is called the root node, and the nodes at the bottom are called leaf nodes. The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root to that node. The depth of the root is 0. The height of a tree with only one node is 0.

Trees are used in many applications, such as file systems, organization charts, and decision trees. They are also used in algorithms like binary search trees, AVL trees, and red-black trees.

## Binary Trees

A binary tree is a tree in which each node has at most two children. The children are referred to as the left child and the right child. A binary tree can be empty, or it can have a root node with a left child and a right child.

Binary trees are used in many applications, such as binary search trees, expression trees, and Huffman trees. They are also used in algorithms like binary tree traversal, binary tree insertion, and binary tree deletion.

## Binary Search Trees

A binary search tree is a binary tree in which each node has a value and a left child and a right child. The left child has a value less than the parent node, and the right child has a value greater than the parent node. This property is called the binary search tree property.

Binary search trees are used in many applications, such as searching, sorting, and indexing. They are also used in algorithms like binary search tree traversal, binary search tree insertion, and binary search tree deletion.
