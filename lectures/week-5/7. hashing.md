# Hashing

Hashing is a technique used to store and retrieve data in a fast and efficient manner. It is a method of storing data in such a way that the data can be retrieved very quickly. The key idea is to use a hash function that maps data to a unique index in a hash table. This allows for constant time access to the data.

Hashing is commonly used in computer science for a variety of applications, such as implementing dictionaries, sets, and caches. 

## Hash Tables

A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values. It consists of an array of buckets, each of which can store one or more key-value pairs. The hash function is used to determine which bucket a key should be stored in.

### Time Complexity

- Insertion: O(1)
- Deletion: O(1)
- Lookup: O(1)
- Search: O(1)

### Example

Suppose we have a hash table with 10 buckets and the following key-value pairs:

- "apple" -> 5
- "banana" -> 10
- "cherry" -> 15
