# Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. The elements are inserted at the rear end and removed from the front end. The element that is inserted first is the one that is removed first.

## Operations on Queue

1. **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the rear end of the queue.

2. **Dequeue**: Removes an element from the front end of the queue.

3. **Peek**: Returns the element at the front end of the queue.

4. **Rear**: Returns the element at the rear end of the queue.

5. **Empty**: Checks if the queue is empty.

6. **Full**: Checks if the queue is full.

## Types of Queue

- **Simple Queue**: A simple queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle.

- **Circular Queue**: A circular queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle and uses a circular array to store the elements.

- **Priority Queue**: A priority queue is a data structure that stores elements based on their priority. The element with the highest priority is removed first.

- **Double-ended Queue (Deque)**: A deque is a linear data structure that allows insertion and deletion of elements from both the front and rear ends.

## Implementation of Queue

A queue can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The following is an example of a queue implemented using an array in C: 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int arr[capacity];
    int size;
} Queue;

// implementation of queue operations
```

## Time Complexity of Queue Operations

1. **Enqueue**: O(1)

2. **Dequeue**: O(1)

3. **Peek**: O(1)

4. **Empty**: O(1)

5. **Full**: O(1)

The time complexity of queue operations is O(1) because the elements are inserted and removed from the front and rear ends of the queue in constant time.
