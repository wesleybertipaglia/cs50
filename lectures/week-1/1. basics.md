# C - Basics

C is a general-purpose programming language, developed in 1972, and still quite popular.

C is very powerful; it has been used to develop operating systems, databases, applications, etc.

## Features of C

- C is a compiled language, which means that the code you write must be translated (compiled) into machine code before it can be run.

- C is a low-level language, which means that it is closer to machine code than high-level languages like Python.

- C is a statically typed language, which means that you must declare the type of each variable before you use it.

- C is a procedural language, which means that you write code in a series of steps.

- C is a case-sensitive language and whitespace-insensitive, which means that `hello`, `Hello`, ` Hello `, and `HELLO` are all different.

C is a language that uses semicolons to end statements.

## Differences between C and C++

- C and C++ are two different languages.
- C++ is a superset of C, which means that C++ includes all of C and more.
- The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not

## Syntax

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 0;
}
```

## Comments

```c
// This is a comment

/* The code below will print the words Hello World!
to the screen, and it is amazing */
```

## Variables

### Variables

```c
int myInt = 15;
float myFloat = 3.14;
char myChar = 'A';
char myString[] 'Hello';
```

### Constants

```c
const int minutesPerHour = 60;
```

### Output

```c
printf("%d\n", myInt);
printf("%f\n", myFloat);
printf("%c\n", myChar);
printf("%s\n", myString);
```

### Input

```c
printf("What's your name? ");
scanf("%s", name);
```
