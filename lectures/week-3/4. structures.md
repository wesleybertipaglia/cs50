# Structures

## Structures

Structures are a way to group variables together. They are similar to classes in object-oriented programming. They are used to group variables of different data types together.

### Declaring Structures

To declare a structure, you use the `struct` keyword followed by the name of the structure and a list of variables inside curly braces. For example:

```c
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};
```

This declares a structure called `Point` with two variables `x` and `y` of type `int`.

### Accessing Structure Members

To access the members of a structure, you use the `.` operator. For example:

```c
struct Point p;
p.x = 10;

printf("x = %d\n", p.x);
```

This creates a structure `Point` called `p` and sets the value of `x` to `10`. It then prints the value of `x`.

### Initializing Structures

You can initialize a structure when you declare it by providing values for its members inside curly braces. For example:

```c
struct Point p = {10, 20};
```

This initializes a structure `Point` called `p` with the values `10` and `20` for its members `x` and `y`.
