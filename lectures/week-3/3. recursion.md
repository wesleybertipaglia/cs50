# Recursion

Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself. It is used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, simpler problems of the same type. Recursion is a powerful tool in computer science and is used in many algorithms and data structures.

A recursive function must have a base case, which is a condition that stops the recursion. Without a base case, the function will keep calling itself indefinitely, resulting in a stack overflow error.

Here is an example of a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number:

```c
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}
```

This function calculates the factorial of a number `n` by multiplying `n` with the factorial of `n - 1`. It stops when `n` reaches `0`, which is the base case.

### Recursion vs. Iteration

Recursion and iteration are two ways to solve problems that involve repetition. Recursion is often more concise and elegant than iteration, but it can be less efficient in terms of memory and performance. Iteration is usually faster and uses less memory than recursion.

### Tail Recursion

Tail recursion is a special case of recursion in which the recursive call is the last thing the function does. Tail recursion can be optimized by the compiler to avoid stack overflow errors. Not all recursive functions can be optimized as tail recursive.

### Example

Here is an example of a tail recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number:

```c
int factorial(int n, int result) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return result;
    } else {
        return factorial(n - 1, n * result);
    }
}
```

This function calculates the factorial of a number `n` by multiplying `n` with the result and passing it to the next recursive call. It stops when `n` reaches `0`, which is the base case.
