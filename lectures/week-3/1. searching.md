# Searching Algorithms

Searching is the process of finding a particular element in the list. It is the most common operation performed on the list. There are different searching algorithms available, the most common are:

1. **Linear Search**: In linear search, we search an element or value in a given array by traversing the array from the starting, till the desired element is found.

2. **Binary Search**: In binary search, we search an element or value in a given array by dividing the array into two halves.

## Linear Search

Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm that searches for an element in a list in sequential order. It is also known as a sequential search. It is used to search for an element in a list where the elements are not in any particular order.

**Time complexity**: O(n), examples:

- n = 8, 8 steps
- n = 16, 16 steps
- n = 32, 32 steps
- n = 64, 64 steps

### Algorithm

1. Start from the first element of the list.
2. Compare the element to be searched with each element of the list.
3. If the element is found, return the index of the element.
4. If the element is not found, return -1.

### Pseudocode

```
function linearSearch(list, element):
    for i from 0 to length of list:
        if list[i] is equal to element:
            return i
    return -1
```

## Binary Search

Binary search is a fast search algorithm with a time complexity of O(log n). This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer. It is used to search for an element in a sorted list.

**Time complexity**: O(log n), examples:

- n = 8, log(8) = 3 steps
- n = 16, log(16) = 4 steps
- n = 32, log(32) = 5 steps
- n = 64, log(64) = 6 steps

### Algorithm

1. Compare the element to be searched with the middle element of the list.
2. If the element is found, return the index of the element.
3. If the element is not found, divide the list into two halves.
4. Repeat the process on the sub-list where the element may be present.
5. If the element is found, return the index of the element.
6. If the element is not found, return -1.

### Pseudocode

```
function binarySearch(list, element):
    low = 0
    high = length of list - 1
    while low is less than or equal to high:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if list[mid] is equal to element:
            return mid
        else if list[mid] is less than element:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```
