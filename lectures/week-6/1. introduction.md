# Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

Python was designed to for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.

So, it is easy to learn and understand the code, even if you are not a computer science student. Here is an example of Python code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Advantages of Python

- Easy to learn, read and maintain
- High-level language
- Interpreted language
- Object-oriented language
- Dynamically typed language
- Automatic memory management
- Open source language

## C vs Python

- C is a low-level language, Python is a high-level language
- C is a compiled language, Python is an interpreted language
- C is statically typed, Python is dynamically typed
- C is not object-oriented, Python is object-oriented
- C is not platform independent, Python is platform independent
- C is not open source, Python is open source
