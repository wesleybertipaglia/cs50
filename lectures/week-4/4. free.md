# Freeing Memory

It is important to free the memory allocated using `malloc` once it is no longer needed. This is done using the `free` function.

```c
void free(void *ptr);
```

### Parameters

- `ptr`: A pointer to the memory block to be deallocated.

### Return Value

- None

### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr;
    ptr = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
    } else {
        printf("Memory allocation successful\n");
    }
    free(ptr);
    return 0;
}
```

In the above example, we have allocated memory for 5 integers using `malloc`. If the memory allocation is successful, we print "Memory allocation successful". Finally, we free the allocated memory using the `free` function.

## Memory Leak

If you forget to free the memory allocated using `malloc`, it can lead to memory leaks. A memory leak occurs when memory is allocated but not deallocated, causing the program to consume more and more memory over time.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr;
    ptr = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
    } else {
        printf("Memory allocation successful\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In the above example, we have allocated memory for 5 integers using `malloc`, but we have forgotten to free the memory. This will result in a memory leak.
