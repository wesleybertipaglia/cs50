# Memory

In a computer system, memory is used to store data and instructions. The data and instructions are stored in memory locations. Each memory location has a unique address. The CPU can read data and instructions from memory and write data to memory.

## Hexadecimal Notation

Memory addresses are usually represented in hexadecimal notation. Hexadecimal notation uses the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F. The hexadecimal number system is base 16, which means that each digit represents 16^x, where x is the position of the digit.

Accoding by convention, all hexadecimal numbers are prefixed with `0x`. For example, the hexadecimal number `0x1A` is equal to 26 in decimal.

So a memory can be represented as a sequence of hexadecimal numbers. For example, the memory locations from `0x1000` to `0x1003` can be represented as:

```
0x1000 0x1001 0x1002 0x1003
```

In your terminal window, type code addresses.c and write your code as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 50;
    printf("%i\n", n);
}
```

The C language has two powerful operators that relate to memory:

- The `&` operator returns the address of a variable.
- The `*` operator returns the value stored at a particular address.

In your terminal window, type code addresses.c and write your code as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 50;
    printf("%p\n", &n);
}
```

Notice the `%p`, which allows us to view the address of a location in memory. `&n` can be literally translated as “the address of `n`.” Executing this code will return an address of memory beginning with `0x`.

## How Memory Works in a Program

In the above diagram, the memory is divided into different sections:

### Machine Code

The machine code is the binary representation of the program. The machine code is stored in the memory and is executed by the CPU.

### Global Variables

Global variables are variables that are declared outside of any function. Global variables are stored in the memory and are accessible from any function.

### Heap

The heap is a section of memory that is used to store dynamically allocated memory. Dynamically allocated memory is memory that is allocated at runtime using functions like `malloc` and `calloc`.

The heap is a large pool of memory that is shared by all the programs running on the computer. The heap is managed by the operating system, which keeps track of which parts of the heap are in use and which parts are free.

### Stack

The stack is a section of memory that is used to store local variables and function calls. When a function is called, the local variables for that function are stored on the stack. When the function returns, the local variables are removed from the stack.

The stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure. This means that the last item added to the stack is the first item removed from the stack.
