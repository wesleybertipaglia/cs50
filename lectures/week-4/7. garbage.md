# Garbage

Garbage is a term used to describe data that is no longer needed or wanted. In programming, garbage is created when a variable is assigned a value, but the value is never used. This can happen when a variable is assigned a value and then the program ends before the value is used, or when a variable is assigned a value and then the value is overwritten by another value.

Garbage can take up memory and slow down a program, so it is important to clean up garbage data to free up memory and improve performance. This process is known as garbage collection, and it is an important part of managing memory in programming languages that do not have automatic memory management.

## Garbage Collection

Garbage collection is the process of automatically identifying and removing garbage data from memory. This is done by the garbage collector, which is a part of the programming language runtime that is responsible for managing memory.

The garbage collector uses a variety of techniques to identify garbage data, such as reference counting, tracing, and mark-and-sweep algorithms. These techniques help the garbage collector determine which data is no longer needed and can be safely removed from memory.

Garbage collection is an important part of managing memory in programming languages that do not have automatic memory management, such as C and C++. By automatically identifying and removing garbage data, the garbage collector helps prevent memory leaks and improve the performance of programs.
