# Overflow

Overflow occurs when a calculation produces a result that is too large to be represented by the data type used to store it. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in programs.

## Stack Overflow

A stack overflow occurs when a program uses more memory than is available on the stack. This can happen when a function calls itself recursively too many times, or when a large amount of data is stored on the stack.

## Heap Overflow

A heap overflow occurs when a program writes data beyond the bounds of a memory block allocated on the heap. This can happen when a program writes more data to a memory block than it can hold, or when a program writes data to a memory block that has already been freed.

## Preventing Overflow

To prevent overflow, it is important to carefully check the size of data being stored and the data types used to store it. Using larger data types or checking for overflow conditions can help prevent unexpected behavior and errors in programs.
