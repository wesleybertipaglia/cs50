# Malloc 

`malloc` is a function in C that is used to allocate memory dynamically. It reserves a block of memory of the specified number of bytes and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block.

```c
void *malloc(size_t size);
```

### Parameters

- `size`: The number of bytes to allocate.

### Return Value

- On success, a pointer to the beginning of the block of memory is returned.

- On failure, `NULL` is returned.

### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr;
    ptr = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
    } else {
        printf("Memory allocation successful\n");
    }
    free(ptr);
    return 0;
}
```

In the above example, we have allocated memory for 5 integers using `malloc`. If the memory allocation is successful, we print "Memory allocation successful". Finally, we free the allocated memory using the `free` function.
