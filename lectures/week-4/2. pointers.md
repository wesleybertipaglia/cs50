# Pointers

A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable. Most succinctly, a pointer is a variable that stores an address in your computer's memory. 

Consider the following code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 50;
    int *p = &n;
    printf("%p\n", p);
}
```

In this code, `p` is a pointer to an integer. The `&` operator returns the address of the variable `n`. The `%p` format specifier is used to print the address stored in the pointer `p`.
