# HTTP Status Codes

## What are HTTP Status Codes?
HTTP status codes are standard response codes issued by web server software in response to a client's request. They indicate the success or failure of a request and provide information about the nature of the response.

## Types of HTTP Status Codes:

### 1. **1xx Informational:**
- **100 Continue**: The server has received the initial part of the request and is willing to process the client's remaining request.

### 2. **2xx Success:**
- **200 OK**: The request has succeeded. The response depends on the method used in the request (e.g., GET returns resource, POST returns created entity).
- **201 Created**: The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.
- **204 No Content**: The server successfully processed the request but is not returning any content.

### 3. **3xx Redirection:**
- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found (Moved Temporarily)**: The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URL.
- **304 Not Modified**: Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the last requested time, allowing the client to use its cached copy.

### 4. **4xx Client Error:**
- **400 Bad Request**: The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed syntax).
- **401 Unauthorized**: The request requires user authentication.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
- **404 Not Found**: The server cannot find the requested resource.

### 5. **5xx Server Error:**
- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error message indicating an unexpected condition encountered by the server.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an inbound server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance.

## Importance of Status Codes:
HTTP status codes provide quick information about the result of a request, helping developers and users understand whether the request was successful, redirected, or encountered an error. They are crucial for troubleshooting and debugging web applications.
